# Rectangular Chuzhoy--Tan Theorem 4.15

The original formal theorem `Section45.theorem415` uses the same parameter
for the requested chain length and for the consecutive-overlap threshold.
The proof of Chuzhoy--Tan Theorem 4.15 does not require that specialization.

This module exposes the rectangular form needed by the exponent-seven
experiment: a chain of length `L` whose consecutive row sets overlap in at
least `W` rows.  The double-counting argument depends on `W`, while the final
weighted source-layer argument depends on `L`.

The explicit hypothesis `0 < W` is necessary for the theorem as stated over
natural numbers.  Without it, the degenerate choice
`N = D = M = 0`, `W = 0`, `L = 1` satisfies all three displayed numerical
inequalities but admits no one-element list in `Fin M`.

/-- Rectangular form of Chuzhoy--Tan Theorem 4.15.

The selected list has length `L`; consecutive selected row sets overlap in at
least `W` rows.  All inequalities are division-free natural-number
inequalities. -/
